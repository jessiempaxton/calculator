  //Initially it looked like it should work, but when tested I saw the bug. First, I tried switching the logic in the if/else statement but received the alert with every division attempt. Then, I replaced "===" with "==" fixing the bug. This threw an error because "===" returns true if operands are strictly equal with no type camparison and "==" converts the operands if they are not the same type, then applies strict comparison. With "===" JavaScript was returning false with every division attempt thus creating the error and breaking the page. However, this does throw a warning in the console.
